	<desc>
		<brief>This sample demonstrates how the order of angles affects the resulting rotation. You can also observe different ways of decomposing the current rotation by various angle sequences.</brief>
		<para>This example helps to understand 3D rotations using Euler angles. It shows how different sequences can lead to different orientations in space.</para>
