	<sdk_desc>Advanced screenshot capturing from multiple windows, cameras, and window groups, with or without GUI.</sdk_desc>
	<desc>
		<brief>
			<para>This sample showcases how to capture high-resolution screenshots from focused windows, individual cameras, the main player camera, or grouped windows in real time, with optional GUI overlays.</para>
			<para>At runtime, several additional windows are created, each with its own dedicated camera for multi-view rendering. All windows are stackable. To create a group, arrange the windows by dragging them close to each other - a green alignment grid will appear to assist with layout. Once grouped, screenshots can be captured from the group view.</para>
			<para>Captured images are saved with timestamped filenames to a user-defined directory. By default, this is the folder displayed in the <ui>Parameters</ui> section.</para>
			<para><strong>Use Cases:</strong></para>
				<ul>
					<li>Capturing viewport content (GUI and non-GUI screenshots)</li>
					<li>Testing multi-camera setups</li>
				</ul>
